project rundown time
fuck im so bad at formal things
the projects goal is to provide an experience that feels authentic and pays respect to the original game but also experimenting with the possibilities that Terraria has provided, generally speaking itd be as if Terraria itself has made a sequel where playing the game would still have the same feeling as it always does but with a fresh new coat of paint
